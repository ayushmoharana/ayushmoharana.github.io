I am a Research Associate at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/scps/physicsandastrophysics/ourpeople/). I am a member of the [SWIPE](https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/swipe/) project, working on pulsating binary stars. I extract pulsations and stellar parameters from eclipsing binaries, which are precise enough to test models of stellar evolution and pulsations. I work on both photmetric, and spectroscopic observations.   

I grew up in Odisha where I graduated  in Physics from the [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/). During my masters, I worked on UV photometric studies of stars in globular clusters.

I did my PhD at the [Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center](https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/) of the Polish Academy of Sciences. I worked on physics of triple stars using eclipsing binaries for my PhD dissertation. During this time I also developed the photometric pipeline for the Solaris network of robotic telescopes. 

I am a trained painter and a autodidactic graphic designer. In my free time, I try working on projects varying across different media and styles.
