I am a Research Associate at [Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/), working on pulsating binary stars. I did my PhD at the [Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center](https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/) of the Polish Academy of Sciences. I worked on physics of triple stars using eclipsing binaries for my PhD dissertation.

I grew up in Odisha where I graduated  in Physics from the [National Institute of Technology, Rourkela](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/). During my masters, I worked on UV photometric studies of stars in globular clusters.
