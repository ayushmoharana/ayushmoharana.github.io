Eclipsing binary stars are our main source of measurements of the properties of normal stars. Their masses and radii can be measure to high precision (0.5% and better) from observational data using only geometry and celestial mechanics. Their temperatures can also be measured directly, although with some difficulty.

Asteroseismology is another important window on the properties of stars: measuring their pulsation frequencies allows a determination of their interior structure (core size, rotation, mixing, age) by comparison to predicted pulsation frequencies from theoretical stellar models.

Eclipsing and pulsating stars allow the two sets of analysis to be performed together on individual stars, leading to better constraints on theoretical models and thus a better understanding of stars.
