Globular clusters (GCs) are gravitaionally bound systems of hundreds of stars. These systems are good laboratories to study stellar evolution as the stars are "believed" to be of the same chemical composition and age. In our work, we use observations from the ultraviolet photometric instrument [UVIT](https://uvit.iiap.res.in/)  on-board the [ASTR0SAT](https://astrosat.iucaa.in/) to study evolved (post-red-giant) stars. 


UVIT, and its UV sensitivity makes it a useful instrument to study evolved stars. It somewhat segregates the UV bright stars, usually evolved stars in old systems like the GCs. Further, the resolution of UVIT is better than other contemporary UV-photometric missions.

We also follow-up interesting targets {% cite 2024A&A...685L...6K %}. with spectroscopy (optical currently) to measure abundances, and radial velocities. This is to constrain any peculiar evolutionary characteristics or check the nature of their multiplicity, if any.
