During my undergraduate days, I was Head of Design at Monday Morning, the newsletter of NIT Rourkela. I was also involved in a lot of other design projects during this time. 

While a lot of the design were lost to time and lack of storage, here are the few that survived:


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
